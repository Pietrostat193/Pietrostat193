## About me

I am a Maclaurin scholar at University of Glasgow, with 4 years of experience in working and applied research projects.  My research mainly focuses on data fusion/downscaling of environmental datasets, but I have a wide experience in forecasting, social science and economic  applications. In addition to my research, I am committed to excellence in teaching. I have taught courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I am also actively involved in providing statistical consultancy service to both private and public organizations. I recently helped the SUERC Radiocarbon Laboratory, while in the past I have collaborating with the Italian research institutes IRS (Institute for Social research) and CREA (National Agriculture Institute). 
Overall, I am deeply committed to advancing knowledge, promoting innovation, and making meaningful contributions to my discipline and society.
